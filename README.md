### Traffic Signal Detection
- Designed a robust traffic sign recognition pipeline for autonomous vehicles, utilizing an Intel RealSense camera for image capture and performed image preprocessing with OpenCV to accurately detect and crop relevant traffic signals
- Developed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow, achieving 99.4% validation accuracy by employing dropout layers to mitigate overfitting and enhance robustness
- Seamlessly integrated image preprocessing and machine learning nodes through ROS2 messaging, ensuring real-time traffic sign evaluation with minimal latency

### Shopalytics
- Collaborated with a team of 4 to develop a web app to help store owners track customer behavior by leveraging YoloV8â€™s computer vision system, along with DeepSORT and OpenCV
- Created a responsive frontend using React, seamlessly integrating it with Flask to display real-time analytics
- Implemented an efficient data pipeline using MongoDB for storage and retrieval of analytics, enabling the computation of insights like individual customer movement patterns and store traffic trends

### Accelerate Deep Learning Model
- Built a deep learning accelerator for an embedded Nios II system to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, leveraging FPGA hardware to offload and accelerate compute-intensive tasks from software using an FPGA. Our performance improved from 4 minutes to 2 seconds per classification.
- Interfaced hardware and software communication, working with off-chip SDRAM to efficiently process data and ensure smooth interaction between the FPGA and embedded processor.

### IoT Sensor Control
- Built a client-server architecture with socket programming for communications between sensors and IoT controller. Leveraged multi-threading to support concurrent client processing, boosting performance by 40%.
- Performed integrated testing using JUnit to verify it can handle 100+ clients with a response time of < 2 seconds

### Simple RISC-Architecture
- Implemented a simple RISC architecture supporting ARM instructions (LDR, MOV, SUB, BL, etc.)
- Designed ALU, Shifter, and Registers, integrating them into the datapath. Controlled datapath using a Finite-State Machine (FSM) for fetch, decode, execute, memory, and writeback stages
- Developed test benches for unit testing and performed integration tests using ModelSim. Verified synthesis by compiling the design on Quartus and tested the RTL synthesis using gate-level testing. Finally, tested on the DE1-SoC FPGA.

### Blackjack Android App Development
- Developed an interactive Blackjack game for Android mobiles, using Java for the game logic and XML for intuitive UI design, enhancing user engagement through responsive and dynamic gameplay.
- Conducted extensive testing across 4 different types of device form factors to ensure the appâ€™s responsiveness and backward compatibility with Android 8.0 (Oreo). Also, tested to verify app doesnâ€™t crash on those devices.

### Engineering Placement Prediction
- Devised an ML model to forecast student job placements graduating from university, achieving an accuracy score of 88.7%
- Conducted data preprocessing, feature engineering, and utilized classification algorithms such as Boosted Decision Tree Classifier along with Random Forest leading to a 30% improvement in model accuracy
- Fine-tuned model performance by employing hyperparameter optimization with grid search, decreasing prediction error by 5%
