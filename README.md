### Full-Stack Web Developer, Demo
**The Ubyssey Publications Society** | Vancouver, BC | Mar. 2024 â€“ Present  
- Contributed to developing a Content Management System for Ubyssey, enabling editors to create e-newspapers efficiently as a lead developer. The website is read by 120,000 unique users every month.
- Developed a responsive events page using React along with SASS, HTML, and Django. This page became the second highest viewed on the website, achieving over 2,000 daily views.
- Implemented automated cross-browser regression testing with Selenium in Docker, integrating it into a CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions to prevent critical bugs from reaching production.
- Improved website performance by 20%, measured by Google Lighthouse, by reducing the loading time of the website.

### Software Development Engineer Co-op
**Microchip** | Vancouver, BC | Jan. 2025 â€“ Present  
- Developed a reference repository to assist developers at NASA in integrating external libraries compatible with SoCâ€™s Linux OS, streamlining third-party library adoption for spaceflight applications.
- Automated external library integration by designing a Jenkins pipeline to build library artifacts, developing Bash scripts, and enabling compatibility with an Ubuntu-based Docker container, reducing manual effort and streamlining deployment.
- Followed Agile methodology with regular sprints and backlog management. Adhered to DevOps practices for CI/CD, ensuring automated builds, testing, and deployments.
